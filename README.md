# Risc-V-Single-Cycle-Architecture-With-CSR
This project implements a RISC-V processor using a single-cycle architecture, where each instruction executes in one clock cycle. It includes Control and Status Registers (CSR) for managing system-level control and status. The design features basic components like the ALU, registers, and memory, ideal for educational purposes.
